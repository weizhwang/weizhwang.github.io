Welcome to my homepage! I am a rising senior majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University. My research interests lie at the intersection of the mathematical foundations of generative models and the empirical advancement of algorithms. Recently, I have been focusing on enhancing the performance of diffusion models by leveraging classical mathematical tools. My broader goal is to develop principled, mathematically grounded methods that push the boundaries of generative modeling in both theory and practice. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) and [Prof. Kaizheng Wang](https://kw2934.github.io/).
